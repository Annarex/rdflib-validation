This is the ROUGH BEGINNINGS of a Python library to validate RDF data against
an OWL ontology, on the assumption that all of the known data should be
relevant and consistent according to the given ontology.

It uses `RDFLib <http://www.github.com/rdflib/rdflib>`_ and the `RDFLib OWL-RL
reasoner <http://www.github.com/rdflib/owl-rl>`_.

I have no idea if I will work on this further, at present.
